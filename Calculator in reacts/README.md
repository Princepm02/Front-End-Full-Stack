# React Calculator App

This folder contains a simple calculator application built using React. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. The calculator's UI and functionality are implemented in the `app.js` file.

## How to Use

1. Enter the first number in the input field labeled "First Number".
2. Enter the second number in the input field labeled "Second Number".
3. Click on one of the operation buttons to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation:
   - "Add" button: Adds the two entered numbers.
   - "Subtract" button: Subtracts the second number from the first number.
   - "Multiply" button: Multiplies the two entered numbers.
   - "Divide" button: Divides the first number by the second number.
4. The result of the selected operation will be displayed below the buttons.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- useState: A React hook used to manage component state.
