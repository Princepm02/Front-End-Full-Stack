## Introduction

The `fade_jQuery.html` file in this repository demonstrates how to use jQuery to create fade-in, fade-out, and fade-toggle effects on HTML elements. These effects provide a smooth transition between the visibility states of elements on a webpage.

The example features three buttons and three colored divs, each representing a different fade effect. By clicking the buttons, you can trigger the corresponding fade animation on the divs.

## Usage

To see the jQuery fade effects in action, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the `fade_jQuery.html` file.
2. Open the `fade_jQuery.html` file in a web browser.

You will see three colored divs and three buttons. Clicking the buttons will apply the fade effects to the divs as described below.

## Fade Effects

The example demonstrates the following fade effects using jQuery:

- **Fade In**: This effect gradually makes the targeted element(s) visible by increasing their opacity. It provides a smooth transition from hidden to visible.
- **Fade Out**: This effect gradually makes the targeted element(s) disappear by decreasing their opacity. It provides a smooth transition from visible to hidden.
- **Fade Toggle**: This effect alternates between fading in and fading out the targeted element(s) based on their current visibility state.

To implement these effects, the code uses the `.fadeIn()`, `.fadeOut()`, and `.fadeToggle()` methods provided by jQuery. These methods accept a duration parameter (in milliseconds) that controls the speed of the fade animation.
