This project uses **AJAX** to create a dynamic Birthday Greeting application. Users can input their birthday, and the application will fetch a customized greeting message without needing to refresh the page.
- **Folder:** `AJAX (Birthday Greetings)`
- **Key Concepts:** AJAX calls, asynchronous JavaScript, DOM manipulation

### 2. AngularJS (List of Planets)
In this project, **AngularJS** is used to display a list of planets in our solar system. The application demonstrates basic AngularJS concepts, including data binding, controllers, and ng-repeat for listing data.
- **Folder:** `AngularJS (List of Planets)`
- **Key Concepts:** AngularJS fundamentals, data binding, Angular directives

### 3. Calculator in React
This is a simple **calculator application** built with **ReactJS**. It performs basic arithmetic operations and showcases React concepts like state management and event handling.
- **Folder:** `Calculator in reacts`
- **Key Concepts:** React components, state, props, event handling

### 4. Canvas Drawing
This project lets users draw on an HTML **canvas** element with basic drawing tools, including different colors and brush sizes. The project demonstrates how to use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML5 canvas API.
- **Folder:** `Canvas Drawing`
- **Key Concepts:** Canvas API, JavaScript events, DOM manipulation

### 5. JQuery (Fade In)
A simple demonstration of the **fade-in effect** using **jQuery**. This project allows users to click a button and make a hidden element fade into view.
- **Folder:** `JQuery (Fade In)`
- **Key Concepts:** jQuery effects, DOM manipulation with jQuery

### 6. JavaScript Odd/Even & Largest
