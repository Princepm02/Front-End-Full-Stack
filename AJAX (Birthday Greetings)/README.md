# AJAX Birthday Greeting Example

This repository contains a simple web page that demonstrates the use of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to display a birthday greeting message. The example consists of two HTML files: `AjaxExample.html` and `surprise.html`.

## Usage

To see the AJAX birthday greeting in action, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ajax-birthday-greeting.git
   ```

2. Open the `AjaxExample.html` file in a web browser.

3. When you open the web page, you will be greeted with a message: "Today's your special day!" and a button that says "Why's that?"

4. Click the "Why's that?" button to trigger an AJAX request. This request will fetch the content of the `surprise.html` file, which contains the birthday greeting message.

5. After clicking the button, the greeting message "It's your birthday!" will be displayed in a larger font and vibrant red color, creating a visually appealing birthday surprise.

## Files

### `AjaxExample.html`

This file is the main HTML page that provides the user interface for the birthday greeting example. It contains:

- A `<h1>` tag displaying the heading "Today's your special day!"
- A button with the text "Why's that?" that triggers the AJAX request when clicked.
- A `<div>` element with the ID `ajax-content` where the fetched content will be displayed.
- Inline JavaScript code that sets up the AJAX request using the `XMLHttpRequest` object and defines a function (`sendTheAJAX()`) to send the request.

### `surprise.html`

This file contains the surprise birthday greeting message. It includes:

- An empty `<head>` section.
- A `<h1>` tag with the ID `birthday-greeting` that contains the text "It's your birthday!".
   
## How It Works

When you click the "Why's that?" button on the main page (`AjaxExample.html`), the JavaScript code uses the `XMLHttpRequest` object to asynchronously fetch the content of the `surprise.html` file. Once the request is complete and the content is received, the fetched greeting message is displayed in the `ajax-content` `<div>`, replacing the button.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the content and styles of the HTML files to suit your preferences. You can change the text, fonts, colors, and more to create your own personalized birthday greeting experience.
